	abstract = {The Hi-C data is the basis of three-dimensional chromosome structure reconstruction. In this paper, a method integrating U-Net and ResNET network is proposed to infer high resolution Hi-C data from existing low-resolution Hi-C data. Firstly, the U-Net is used as the backbone network to make full use of the shallow layer details and deep layer essential features of Hi-C data. Secondly, the residual module is introduced into the coding path and decoding path of the network to increase the depth of the model and prevent network degradation. Finally, the down sampling is used to reduce the calculation amount to decrease the required running time for the network model. The experimental results on real datasets showed that the proposed method had better performance than existing methods, and the inferred high resolution Hi-C data was closer to the real Hi-C data.},

	abstract = {Hi-C experiments allow researchers to study and understand the 3D genome organization and its regulatory function. Unfortunately, sequencing costs and technical constraints severely restrict access to high-quality Hi-C data for many cell types. Existing frameworks rely on a sparse Hi-C dataset or cheaper-to-acquire ChIP-seq data to predict Hi-C contact maps with high read coverage. However, these methods fail to generalize to sparse or cross-cell-type inputs because they do not account for the contributions of epigenomic features or the impact of the structural neighborhood in predicting Hi-C reads. We propose GrapHiC, which combines Hi-C and ChIP-seq in a graph representation, allowing more accurate embedding of structural and epigenomic features. Each node represents a binned genomic region, and we assign edge weights using the observed Hi-C reads. Additionally, we embed ChIP-seq and relative positional information as node attributes, allowing our representation to capture structural neighborhoods and the contributions of proteins and their modifications for predicting Hi-C reads. Our evaluations show that GrapHiC generalizes better than the current state-of-the-art on cross-cell-type settings and sparse Hi-C inputs. Moreover, we can utilize our framework to impute Hi-C reads even when no Hi-C contact map is available, thus making high-quality Hi-C data more accessible for many cell types.

	abstract = {High-resolution Hi-C contact matrices reveal the detailed three-dimensional architecture of the genome, but high-coverage experimental Hi-C data are expensive to generate. Simultaneously, chromatin structure analyses struggle with extremely sparse contact matrices. To address this problem, computational methods to enhance low-coverage contact matrices have been developed, but existing methods are largely based on resolution enhancement methods for natural images and hence often employ models that do not distinguish between biologically meaningful contacts, such as loops and other stochastic contacts.We present Capricorn, a machine learning model for Hi-C resolution enhancement that incorporates small-scale chromatin features as additional views of the input Hi-C contact matrix and leverages a diffusion probability model backbone to generate a high-coverage matrix. We show that Capricorn outperforms the state of the art in a cross-cell-line setting, improving on existing methods by 17\% in mean squared error and 26\% in F1 score for chromatin loop identification from the generated high-coverage data. We also demonstrate that Capricorn performs well in the cross-chromosome setting and cross-chromosome, cross-cell-line setting, improving the downstream loop F1 score by 14\% relative to existing methods. We further show that our multiview idea can also be used to improve several existing methods, HiCARN and HiCNN, indicating the wide applicability of this approach. Finally, we use DNA sequence to validate discovered loops and find that the fraction of CTCF-supported loops from Capricorn is similar to those identified from the high-coverage data. Capricorn is a powerful Hi-C resolution enhancement method that enables scientists to find chromatin features that cannot be identified in the low-coverage contact matrix.Implementation of Capricorn and source code for reproducing all figures in this paper are available at https://github.com/CHNFTQ/Capricorn.},

Here we present DeepLoop, which performs rigorous bias correction followed by deep-learning-based signal enhancement for robust chromatin interaction mapping from low-depth Hi-C data. DeepLoop enables loop-resolution, single-cell Hi-C analysis. It also achieves a cross-platform convergence between different Hi-C protocols and micrococcal nuclease (micro-C). DeepLoop allowed us to map the genetic and epigenetic determinants of allele-specific chromatin interactions in the human genome. We nominate new loci with allele-specific interactions governed by imprinting or allelic DNA methylation. We also discovered that, in the inactivated X chromosome (Xi), local loops at the DXZ4 ‘megadomain’ boundary escape X-inactivation but the FIRRE ‘superloop’ locus does not. Importantly, DeepLoop can pinpoint heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms and large structure variants that cause allelic chromatin loops, many of which rewire enhancers with transcription consequences. Taken together, DeepLoop expands the use of Hi-C to provide loop-resolution insights into the genetics of the three-dimensional genome.},

	abstract = {Fit-Hi-C is a programming application to compute statistical confidence estimates for Hi-C contact maps to identify significant chromatin contacts. By fitting a monotonically non-increasing spline, Fit-Hi-C captures the relationship between genomic distance and contact probability without any parametric assumption. The spline fit together with the correction of contact probabilities with respect to bin- or locus-specific biases accounts for previously characterized covariates impacting Hi-C contact counts. Fit-Hi-C is best applied for the study of mid-range (e.g., 20 kb–2 Mb for human genome) intra-chromosomal contacts; however, with the latest reimplementation, named FitHiC2, it is possible to perform genome-wide analysis for high-resolution Hi-C data, including all intra-chromosomal distances and inter-chromosomal contacts. FitHiC2 also offers a merging filter module, which eliminates indirect/bystander interactions, leading to significant reduction in the number of reported contacts without sacrificing recovery of key loops such as those between convergent CTCF binding sites. Here, we describe how to apply the FitHiC2 protocol to three use cases: (i) 5-kb resolution Hi-C data of chromosome 5 from GM12878 (a human lymphoblastoid cell line), (ii) 40-kb resolution whole-genome Hi-C data from IMR90 (human lung fibroblast), and (iii) budding yeast whole-genome Hi-C data at a single restriction cut site (EcoRI) resolution. The procedure takes {\textasciitilde}12 h with preprocessing when all use cases are run sequentially ({\textasciitilde}4 h when run parallel). With the recent improvements in its implementation, FitHiC2 (8 processors and 16 GB memory) is also scalable to genome-wide analysis of the highest resolution (1 kb) Hi-C data available to date ({\textasciitilde}48 h with 32 GB peak memory). FitHiC2 is available through Bioconda, GitHub and the Python Package Index.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Hi-C is a widely used technique to study the 3D organization of the genome. Due to its high sequencing cost, most of the generated datasets are of coarse quality, consequently limiting the quality of the downstream analyses. Recently, multiple deep learning-based methods have been proposed to improve the quality of these data sets by increasing their resolution through upscaling. However, the existing works do not thoroughly evaluate these methods using Hi-C reproducibility metrics across different Hi-C experiments to establish their generalizability to real-world scenarios. This study extensively compares deep learning-based Hi-C upscaling methods on real-world, Hi-C datasets with lower read counts. We evaluate these models using Hi-C reproducibility metrics and downstream evaluation on data from three cell lines – GM12878 (lymphoblastoid), K562 (human erythroleukemic), and IMR90 (lung fibroblast) – obtained from different Hi-C experiments. Results: We show that the existing deep-learning-based Hi-C upscaling techniques are inadequate for effectively upscaling Hi-C data with low read counts. We observe that retraining these models with real-world datasets substantially improves the performance of these methods, both Hi-C similarity metrics, and downstream tasks. However, we find that Hi-C upscaling methods struggle to capture the underlying biological signals on sparse datasets even when retrained with real-world datasets. Therefore, our study highlights the need for rigorous evaluation and identifies specific improvement areas concerning current deep learning-based Hi-C upscaling methods. We facilitate our thorough analysis by developing a computational pipeline that provides a unified platform for pre-processing, upscaling, and evaluating the generated Hi-C data quality for for users interested in benchmarking or using these methods.},

Here, high resolution data plays a particularly important role as many chromatin substructures such as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops cannot be adequately studied with low resolution contact maps. However, the high sequencing costs associated with the generation of high resolution Hi-C data has become an experimental barrier. By carefully examining the properties of Hi-C maps and integrating various recent advances in deep learning, we developed a Hi-C Super-Resolution (HiCSR) framework capable of accurately recovering the fine details, textures, and substructures found in high resolution contact maps. The resulting framework can generate enhanced Hi-C maps more visually similar to the original high resolution maps, and also excels on a suite of reproducibility metrics produced by members of the ENCODE Consortium compared to existing approaches.},

	abstract = {Hi-C technology has been the most widely used chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiment that measures the frequency of all paired interactions in the entire genome, which is a powerful tool for studying the 3D structure of the genome. The fineness of the constructed genome structure depends on the resolution of Hi-C data. However, due to the fact that high-resolution Hi-C data require deep sequencing and thus high experimental cost, most available Hi-C data are in low-resolution. Hence, it is essential to enhance the quality of Hi-C data by developing the effective computational methods.In this work, we propose a novel method, so-called DFHiC, which generates the high-resolution Hi-C matrix from the low-resolution Hi-C matrix in the framework of the dilated convolutional neural network. The dilated convolution is able to effectively explore the global patterns in the overall Hi-C matrix by taking advantage of the information of the Hi-C matrix in a way of the longer genomic distance. Consequently, DFHiC can improve the resolution of the Hi-C matrix reliably and accurately. More importantly, the super-resolution Hi-C data enhanced by DFHiC is more in line with the real high-resolution Hi-C data than those done by the other existing methods, in terms of both chromatin significant interactions and identifying topologically associating domains.https://github.com/BinWangCSU/DFHiC.},

The resolution of Hi-C data directly impacts the effectiveness and accuracy of downstream analysis such as identifying topologically associating domains (TADs) and meaningful chromatin loops. High resolution Hi-C data are valuable resources which implicate the relationship between 3D genome conformation and function, especially linking distal regulatory elements to their target genes. However, high resolution Hi-C data across various tissues and cell types are not always available due to the high sequencing cost. It is therefore indispensable to develop computational approaches for enhancing the resolution of Hi-C data.We proposed hicGAN, an open-sourced framework, for inferring high resolution Hi-C data from low resolution Hi-C data with generative adversarial networks (GANs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply GANs to 3D genome analysis. We demonstrate that hicGAN effectively enhances the resolution of low resolution Hi-C data by generating matrices that are highly consistent with the original high resolution Hi-C matrices. A typical scenario of usage for our approach is to enhance low resolution Hi-C data in new cell types, especially where the high resolution Hi-C data are not available. Our study not only presents a novel approach for enhancing Hi-C data resolution, but also provides fascinating insights into disclosing complex mechanism underlying the formation of chromatin contacts.We release hicGAN as an open-sourced software at https://github.com/kimmo1019/hicGAN.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The development of single-cell technologies for probing the 3D genome conformation, especially single-cell chromosome conformation capture techniques, has enabled us to understand genome function better than before. However, due to extreme sparsity and high noise associated with single-cell Hi-C data, it is still difficult to study genome structure and function using the HiC-data of one single cell.In this work, we developed a deep learning method ScHiCEDRN based on deep residual networks and generative adversarial networks for the imputation and enhancement of Hi-C data of a single cell. In terms of both image evaluation and Hi-C reproducibility metrics, ScHiCEDRN outperforms the four deep learning methods (DeepHiC, HiCPlus, HiCSR, and Loopenhance) on enhancing the raw single-cell Hi-C data of human and Drosophila. The experiments also show that it can generate single-cell Hi-C data more suitable for identifying topologically associating domain boundaries and reconstructing 3D chromosome structures than the existing methods. Moreover, ScHiCEDRN’s performance generalizes well across different single cells and cell types, and it can be applied to improving population Hi-C data.The source code of ScHiCEDRN is available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/ScHiCEDRN.},

With two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography (2D-HPLC) technology, protein A (ProA) affinity chromatography can be used in the first dimension to isolate and measure the concentration of mAb, with the effluent transferred to a second dimension of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to measure purity (i.e. aggregation). Described here is a 2D-HPLC method for characterizing mAb concentration and aggregation level, combining ProA purification, a novel injector-loop capture step, and aggregation determination by SEC. Unique here, polyester capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are packed into PEEK tubing and used as the inter-column injection loop, capturing and releasing the mAbs via a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) process. The applicability of the HIC capture method was investigated on three ProA columns, including a homemade C-CP fiber format, and commercial POROS® A 20 μm and TSKgel Protein A-5PW columns. The HIC fiber capture loop was compared with standard, open sample loops in terms of solute recoveries, degree of affected aggregation, and chromatographic resolution. Advantages are seen in terms of limiting in-system mAb aggregation due to reduced low-pH solvent exposure, improved 2D chromatographic resolution, better monomer/aggregate ratio fidelity, and enhanced quantitative figures of merit.},

Current approaches focus on the analysis of individual Hi-C data sets of interest, without taking advantage of the facts that (i) several hundred Hi-C contact maps are publicly available, and (ii) the vast majority of topological structures are conserved across multiple cell types. Here, we present RefHiC, an attention-based deep learning framework that uses a reference panel of Hi-C datasets to facilitate topological structure annotation from a given study sample.

Due to its high sequencing cost, most of the generated datasets are of a coarse resolution, which makes it impractical to study finer chromatin features such as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops. Multiple deep learning-based methods have recently been proposed to increase the resolution of these datasets by imputing Hi-C reads (typically called upscaling). However, the existing works evaluate these methods on either synthetically downsampled datasets, or a small subset of experimentally generated sparse Hi-C datasets, making it hard to establish their generalizability in the real-world use case. We present our framework—Hi-CY—that compares existing Hi-C resolution upscaling methods on seven experimentally generated low-resolution Hi-C datasets belonging to various levels of read sparsities originating from three cell lines on a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics. Hi-CY also includes four downstream analysis tasks, such as TAD and chromatin loops recall, to provide a thorough report on the generalizability of these methods. We observe that existing deep learning methods fail to generalize to experimentally generated sparse Hi-C datasets, showing a performance reduction of up to 57\%. As a potential solution, we find that retraining deep learning-based methods with experimentally generated Hi-C datasets improves performance by up to 31\%. More importantly, Hi-CY shows that even with retraining, the existing deep learning-based methods struggle to recover biological features such as chromatin loops and TADs when provided with sparse Hi-C datasets. Our study, through the Hi-CY framework, highlights the need for rigorous evaluation in the future. We identify specific avenues for improvements in the current deep learning-based Hi-C upscaling methods, including but not limited to using experimentally generated datasets for training.},

In the experiment, Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the similarity between the generated high-resolution matrix and the real high-resolution hi-c matrix in numerical distribution. the apparent interaction pairs were analyzed by Fit-Hi-C, and calling ChromHMM annotates state of 12 kinds of chromatin.
