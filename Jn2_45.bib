	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the exploration of biological heterogeneity among different cell types within tissues at a resolution. Inferring cell types within tissues is foundational for downstream research. Most existing methods for cell type inference based on scRNA-seq data primarily utilize highly variable genes (HVGs) with higher expression levels as clustering features, overlooking the contribution of HVGs with lower expression levels. To address this, we have designed a novel cell type inference method for scRNA-seq data, termed scLEGA. scLEGA employs a novel zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) loss function that fully considers the contribution of genes with lower expression levels and combines two distinct scRNA-seq clustering strategies through a multi-head attention mechanism. It utilizes a low-expression optimized denoising autoencoder, based on the novel ZINB model, to extract low-dimensional features and handle dropout events, and a GCN-based graph autoencoder (GAE) that leverages neighbor information to guide dimensionality reduction. The iterative fusion of denoising and topological embedding in scLEGA facilitates the acquisition of cluster-friendly cell representations in the hidden embedding, where similar cells are brought closer together. Compared to 12 state-of-the-art cell type inference methods on 15 scRNA-seq datasets, scLEGA demonstrates superior performance in clustering accuracy, scalability, and stability. Our scLEGA model codes are freely available at https://github.com/Masonze/scLEGA-main.},

The scLEGA is an attention-based cell type imputation methon that leverages zero-inflated negative binomial loss function. Considering the the adaptability of attention-based models in HiC data resolution enhancement models, I am open to the possible exploration of the ZINB loss function and any other variations the scLEGA model has to offer towards possible refinement of any attention-based approach in my research domain.

	abstract = {Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is increasingly used to treat various tumor types. Determining patient responses to ICIs presents a significant clinical challenge. Although components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) are used to predict patient outcomes, comprehensive assessments of the TME are frequently overlooked. Using a top-down approach, the TME was divided into five layers—outcome, immune role, cell, cellular component, and gene. Using this structure, a neural network called TME-NET was developed to predict responses to ICIs. Model parameter weights and cell ablation studies were used to investigate the influence of TME components. The model was developed and evaluated using a pan-cancer cohort of 948 patients across four cancer types, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) and accuracy as performance metrics. Results show that TME-NET surpasses established models such as support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors in AUC and accuracy. Visualization of model parameter weights showed that at the cellular layer, Th1 cells enhance immune responses, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells and M2 macrophages show strong immunosuppressive effects. Cell ablation studies further confirmed the impact of these cells. At the gene layer, the transcription factors STAT4 in Th1 cells and IRF4 in M2 macrophages significantly affect TME dynamics. Additionally, the cytokine-encoding genes IFNG from Th1 cells and ARG1 from M2 macrophages are crucial for modulating immune responses within the TME. Survival data from immunotherapy cohorts confirmed the prognostic ability of these markers, with p-values \&lt;0.01. In summary, TME-NET performs well in predicting immunotherapy responses and offers interpretable insights into the immunotherapy process. It can be customized at https://immbal.shinyapps.io/TME-NET.},

DNA molecules, due to their stability, storage capacity, and density, offer a promising solution for information storage. However, DNA storage also faces numerous challenges, such as complex biochemical constraints and encoding efficiency. This paper presents Explorer, a high-efficiency DNA coding algorithm based on the De Bruijn graph, which leverages its capability to characterize local sequences. Explorer enables coding under various biochemical constraints, such as homopolymers, GC content, and undesired motifs. This paper also introduces Codeformer, a fast decoding algorithm based on the transformer architecture, to further enhance decoding efficiency. Numerical experiments indicate that, compared with other advanced algorithms, Explorer not only achieves stable encoding and decoding under various biochemical constraints but also increases the encoding efficiency and bit rate by ¿10\%. Additionally, Codeformer demonstrates the ability to efficiently decode large quantities of DNA sequences. Under different parameter settings, its decoding efficiency exceeds that of traditional algorithms by more than two-fold. When Codeformer is combined with Reed–Solomon code, its decoding accuracy exceeds 99\%, making it a good choice for high-speed decoding applications. These advancements are expected to contribute to the development of DNA-based data storage systems and the broader exploration of DNA as a novel information storage medium.},

	abstract = {The annotation of enzyme function is a fundamental challenge in industrial biotechnology and pathologies. Numerous computational methods have been proposed to predict enzyme function by annotating enzyme labels with Enzyme Commission number. However, the existing methods face difficulties in modelling the hierarchical structure of enzyme label in a global view. Moreover, they haven’t gone entirely to leverage the mutual interactions between different levels of enzyme label. In this paper, we formulate the hierarchy of enzyme label as a directed enzyme graph and propose a hierarchy-GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) encoder to globally model enzyme label dependency on the enzyme graph. Based on the enzyme hierarchy encoder, we develop an end-to-end hierarchical-aware global model named GloEC to predict enzyme function. GloEC learns hierarchical-aware enzyme label embeddings via the hierarchy-GCN encoder and conducts deductive fusion of label-aware enzyme features to predict enzyme labels. Meanwhile, our hierarchy-GCN encoder is designed to bidirectionally compute to investigate the enzyme label correlation information in both bottom-up and top-down manners, which has not been explored in enzyme function prediction. Comparative experiments on three benchmark datasets show that GloEC achieves better predictive performance as compared to the existing methods. The case studies also demonstrate that GloEC is capable of effectively predicting the function of isoenzyme. GloEC is available at: https://github.com/hyr0771/GloEC.},

To dissect transcriptional regulation in TII cells, we first integrated the gene expression profiles from single-cell datasets, and proposed a computational pipeline to identify TII cell type-specific transcription factor (TF) mediated activity immune modules (TF-AIMs). Our analysis revealed key TFs, such as BACH2 and NFKB1 play important roles in B and NK cells, respectively. We also found some of these TF-AIMs may contribute to tumor pathogenesis.

Furthermore, the TII cell type-specific TF-AIMs displayed the potential to be used as predictive markers for immunotherapy response of cancer patients. At the pan-cancer level, we also identified and characterized six molecular subtypes across 9680 samples based on the activation status of TII cell type-specific TF-AIMs. Finally, we constructed a user-friendly web interface CellTF-AIMs (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellTF-AIMs/) for exploring transcriptional regulatory pattern in various TII cell types.

Therefore, investigation of the metabolic fate of a drug candidate is of great significance for drug discovery. Computational methods have been developed to predict drug metabolites, but most of them suffer from two main obstacles: the lack of model generalization due to restrictions on metabolic transformation rules or specific enzyme families, and high rate of false-positive predictions. Here, we presented MetaPredictor, a rule-free, end-to-end and prompt-based method to predict possible human metabolites of small molecules including drugs as a sequence translation problem. We innovatively introduced prompt engineering into deep language models to enrich domain knowledge and guide decision-making. The results showed that using prompts that specify the sites of metabolism (SoMs) can steer the model to propose more accurate metabolite predictions, achieving a 30.4\% increase in recall and a 16.8\% reduction in false positives over the baseline model. The transfer learning strategy was also utilized to tackle the limited availability of metabolic data. For the adaptation to automatic or non-expert prediction, MetaPredictor was designed as a two-stage schema consisting of automatic identification of SoMs followed by metabolite prediction. Compared to four available drug metabolite prediction tools, our method showed comparable performance on the major enzyme families and better generalization that could additionally identify metabolites catalyzed by less common enzymes. The results indicated that MetaPredictor could provide a more comprehensive and accurate prediction of drug metabolism through the effective combination of transfer learning and prompt-based learning strategies.},

We characterized the profiles of 22 260 IPAs in 9679 patient samples across 32 cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. By comparing tumor and paired normal tissues, we identified 180 {\textasciitilde} 4645 dysregulated IPAs in 132 {\textasciitilde} 2249 genes in each of 690 patient tumors from 22 cancer types that showed consistent patterns within individual cancer types. We selected 2741 genes that showed consistently patterns across cancer types, including 1834 pan-cancer tumor-enriched and 907 tumor-depleted IPA genes; the former were amply represented in the functional pathways such as deoxyribonucleic acid damage repair. Expression of IPA isoforms was associated with tumor mutation burden and patient characteristics (e.g. sex, race, cancer stages, and subtypes) in cancer-specific and feature-specific manners, and could be a more accurate prognostic marker than gene expression (summary of all isoforms). In summary, our study reveals the roles and the clinical relevance of tumor-associated IPAs.},

	abstract = {PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) has recently emerged as a promising technology. However, the design of rational PROTACs, especially the linker component, remains challenging due to the absence of structure–activity relationships and experimental data. Leveraging the structural characteristics of PROTACs, fragment-based drug design (FBDD) provides a feasible approach for PROTAC research. Concurrently, artificial intelligence–generated content has attracted considerable attention, with diffusion models and Transformers emerging as indispensable tools in this field. In response, we present a new diffusion model, DiffPROTACs, harnessing the power of Transformers to learn and generate new PROTAC linkers based on given ligands. To introduce the essential inductive biases required for molecular generation, we propose the O(3) equivariant graph Transformer module, which augments Transformers with graph neural networks (GNNs), using Transformers to update nodes and GNNs to update the coordinates of PROTAC atoms. DiffPROTACs effectively competes with existing models and achieves comparable performance on two traditional FBDD datasets, ZINC and GEOM. To differentiate the molecular characteristics between PROTACs and traditional small molecules, we fine-tuned the model on our self-built PROTACs dataset, achieving a 93.86\% validity rate for generated PROTACs. Additionally, we provide a generated PROTAC database for further research, which can be accessed at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/service/DiffPROTACs-generated.tgz.

Virtual saturation mutagenesis was applied based on the predicted binding sites of KvAP, and the top-ranked 10 single mutations contributed to stronger enzyme–substrate binding varied while the predicted sites were different. The advantage of DUnet for predicting key residues responsible for enzyme activity further promoted the success rate of virtual mutagenesis.

	abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are powerful tools for predicting cellular metabolic and physiological states. However, there are still missing reactions in GEMs due to incomplete knowledge. Recent gaps filling methods suggest directly predicting missing responses without relying on phenotypic data. However, they do not differentiate between substrates and products when constructing the prediction models, which affects the predictive performance of the models. In this paper, we propose a hyperedge prediction model that distinguishes substrates and products based on dual-scale fused hypergraph convolution, DSHCNet, for inferring the missing reactions to effectively fill gaps in the GEM. First, we model each hyperedge as a heterogeneous complete graph and then decompose it into three subgraphs at both homogeneous and heterogeneous scales. Then we design two graph convolution-based models to, respectively, extract features of the vertices in two scales, which are then fused via the attention mechanism. Finally, the features of all vertices are further pooled to generate the representative feature of the hyperedge. The strategy of graph decomposition in DSHCNet enables the vertices to engage in message passing independently at both scales, thereby enhancing the capability of information propagation and making the obtained product and substrate features more distinguishable. The experimental results show that the average recovery rate of missing reactions obtained by DSHCNet is at least 11.7\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art methods, and that the gap-filled GEMs based on our DSHCNet model achieve the best prediction performance, demonstrating the superiority of our method.},

Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) is a robust method that has been routinely used in GS breeding programs. However, GBLUP assumes that markers contribute equally to the total genetic variance, which may not be the case. In this study, we developed a novel GS method called GA-GBLUP that leverages the genetic algorithm (GA) to select markers related to the target trait. We defined four fitness functions for optimization, including AIC, BIC, R2, and HAT, to improve the predictability and bin adjacent markers based on the principle of linkage disequilibrium to reduce model dimension. The results demonstrate that the GA-GBLUP model, equipped with R2 and HAT fitness function, produces much higher predictability than GBLUP for most traits in rice and maize datasets, particularly for traits with low heritability. Moreover, we have developed a user-friendly R package, GAGBLUP, for GS, and the package is freely available on CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GAGBLUP).},

The enzyme turnover number (kcat) and Michaelis constant (Km), key kinetic parameters for measuring enzyme catalytic efficiency, are crucial for analyzing enzymatic reaction mechanisms and the directed evolution of target enzymes. Experimental determination of kcat and Km is costly in terms of time, labor, and cost. To consider the intrinsic connection between kcat and Km and further improve the prediction performance, we propose a universal pretrained multitask deep learning model, MPEK, to predict these parameters simultaneously while considering pH, temperature, and organismal information. Through testing on the same kcat and Km test datasets, MPEK demonstrated superior prediction performance over the previous models. Specifically, MPEK achieved the Pearson coefficient of 0.808 for predicting kcat, improving ca. 14.6\% and 7.6\% compared to the DLKcat and UniKP models, and it achieved the Pearson coefficient of 0.777 for predicting Km, improving ca. 34.9\% and 53.3\% compared to the Kroll\_model and UniKP models. More importantly, MPEK was able to reveal enzyme promiscuity and was sensitive to slight changes in the mutant enzyme sequence. In addition, in three case studies, it was shown that MPEK has the potential for assisted enzyme mining and directed evolution. To facilitate in silico evaluation of enzyme catalytic efficiency, we have established a web server implementing this model, which can be accessed at http://mathtc.nscc-tj.cn/mpek.},

While there is an abundance of neuronal morphologies available online, e.g. from NeuroMorpho.Org, converting those fairly abstract point-and-diameter representations into geometrically realistic and simulation-ready, i.e. watertight, manifolds is challenging. Many neuronal mesh reconstruction methods have been proposed; however, their resulting meshes are either biologically unplausible or non-watertight. We present an effective and unconditionally robust method capable of generating geometrically realistic and watertight surface manifolds of spiny cortical neurons from their morphological descriptions. The robustness of our method is assessed based on a mixed dataset of cortical neurons with a wide variety of morphological classes. The implementation is seamlessly extended and applied to synthetic astrocytic morphologies that are also plausibly biological in detail. Resulting meshes are ultimately used to create volumetric meshes with tetrahedral domains to perform scalable in silico reaction-diffusion simulations for revealing cellular structure–function relationships.

This paper pivots on the need to synthesize neuronal morphologies from brain cells into 3D geometries, providing an avenue for the capturing of cellular membrane structures, a concept requiring 'Mesh reconstruction". This paper intoduces a model that performs this function better than existing models. Although fairly lacking symmetry with my resesarch domain, I am curious to find out what Mesh reconstruction entails and how it can be related to HiC data reconstruction.

	abstract = {Influenza viruses rapidly evolve to evade previously acquired human immunity. Maintaining vaccine efficacy necessitates continuous monitoring of antigenic differences among strains. Traditional serological methods for assessing these differences are labor-intensive and time-consuming, highlighting the need for efficient computational approaches. This paper proposes MetaFluAD, a meta-learning-based method designed to predict quantitative antigenic distances among strains. This method models antigenic relationships between strains, represented by their hemagglutinin (HA) sequences, as a weighted attributed network. Employing a graph neural network (GNN)-based encoder combined with a robust meta-learning framework, MetaFluAD learns comprehensive strain representations within a unified space encompassing both antigenic and genetic features. Furthermore, the meta-learning framework enables knowledge transfer across different influenza subtypes, allowing MetaFluAD to achieve remarkable performance with limited data. MetaFluAD demonstrates excellent performance and overall robustness across various influenza subtypes, including A/H3N2, A/H1N1, A/H5N1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. MetaFluAD synthesizes the strengths of GNN-based encoding and meta-learning to offer a promising approach for accurate antigenic distance prediction. Additionally, MetaFluAD can effectively identify dominant antigenic clusters within seasonal influenza viruses, aiding in the development of effective vaccines and efficient monitoring of viral evolution.},

Although this research was done in using virus data, the paper proposed MetaFluAD designed to predict distances between the influenza viruses. However, in Genomic Research, the HiC dataset is made up of interaction frequencies which are inversely proportional to pairwise distances of genomic loci. There is a possibility that the meta-learning idea in this paper will suggest an alternative to the dominant supervised learning approach currently being used in the HiC resolution enhancement research domain.

To facilitate this, researchers have developed computational tools to categorize samples as having high microsatellite instability, or as being microsatellite stable using next-generation sequencing data. Most of these tools were published with unclear scope and usage, and they have yet to be independently benchmarked. To address these issues, we assessed the performance of eight leading MSI tools across several unique datasets that encompass a wide variety of sequencing methods. While we were able to replicate the original findings of each tool on whole exome sequencing data, most tools had worse receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall area under the curve values on whole genome sequencing data. We also found that they lacked agreement with one another and with commercial MSI software on gene panel data, and that optimal threshold cut-offs vary by sequencing type. Lastly, we tested tools made specifically for RNA sequencing data and found they were outperformed by tools designed for use with DNA sequencing data. Out of all, two tools (MSIsensor2, MANTIS) performed well across nearly all datasets, but when all datasets were combined, their precision decreased. Our results caution that MSI tools can have much lower performance on datasets other than those on which they were originally evaluated, and in the case of RNA sequencing tools, can even perform poorly on the type of data for which they were created.},

	abstract = {The molecular property prediction (MPP) plays a crucial role in the drug discovery process, providing valuable insights for molecule evaluation and screening. Although deep learning has achieved numerous advances in this area, its success often depends on the availability of substantial labeled data. The few-shot MPP is a more challenging scenario, which aims to identify unseen property with only few available molecules. In this paper, we propose an attribute-guided prototype network (APN) to address the challenge. APN first introduces an molecular attribute extractor, which can not only extract three different types of fingerprint attributes (single fingerprint attributes, dual fingerprint attributes, triplet fingerprint attributes) by considering seven circular-based, five path-based, and two substructure-based fingerprints, but also automatically extract deep attributes from self-supervised learning methods. Furthermore, APN designs the Attribute-Guided Dual-channel Attention module to learn the relationship between the molecular graphs and attributes and refine the local and global representation of the molecules. Compared with existing works, APN leverages high-level human-defined attributes and helps the model to explicitly generalize knowledge in molecular graphs. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that APN can achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases and demonstrate that the attributes are effective for improving few-shot MPP performance. In addition, the strong generalization ability of APN is verified by conducting experiments on data from different domains.},

	abstract = {Understanding the genetic basis of disease is a fundamental aspect of medical research, as genes are the classic units of heredity and play a crucial role in biological function. Identifying associations between genes and diseases is critical for diagnosis, prevention, prognosis, and drug development. Genes that encode proteins with similar sequences are often implicated in related diseases, as proteins causing identical or similar diseases tend to show limited variation in their sequences. Predicting gene–disease association (GDA) requires time-consuming and expensive experiments on a large number of potential candidate genes. Although methods have been proposed to predict associations between genes and diseases using traditional machine learning algorithms and graph neural networks, these approaches struggle to capture the deep semantic information within the genes and diseases and are dependent on training data. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel GDA prediction model named FusionGDA, which utilizes a pre-training phase with a fusion module to enrich the gene and disease semantic representations encoded by pre-trained language models. Multi-modal representations are generated by the fusion module, which includes rich semantic information about two heterogeneous biomedical entities: protein sequences and disease descriptions. Subsequently, the pooling aggregation strategy is adopted to compress the dimensions of the multi-modal representation. In addition, FusionGDA employs a pre-training phase leveraging a contrastive learning loss to extract potential gene and disease features by training on a large public GDA dataset. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the FusionGDA model, we conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and compare our proposed model with five competitive baseline models on the DisGeNet-Eval dataset. Notably, our case study further demonstrates the ability of FusionGDA to discover hidden associations effectively. The complete code and datasets of our experiments are available at https://github.com/ZhaohanM/FusionGDA.},

It is essential for a deeper insight into their functions and mechanisms by detecting their subcellular localizations. The traditional methods for determining miRNAs subcellular localizations are expensive. The computational methods are alternative ways to quickly predict miRNAs subcellular localizations. Although several computational methods have been proposed in this regard, the incomplete representations of miRNAs in these methods left the room for improvement. In this study, a novel computational method for predicting miRNA subcellular localizations, named PMiSLocMF, was developed. As lots of miRNAs have multiple subcellular localizations, this method was a multi-label classifier. Several properties of miRNA, such as miRNA sequences, miRNA functional similarity, miRNA-disease, miRNA-drug, and miRNA–mRNA associations were adopted for generating informative miRNA features. To this end, powerful algorithms [node2vec and graph attention auto-encoder (GATE)] and one newly designed scheme were adopted to process above properties, producing five feature types. All features were poured into self-attention and fully connected layers to make predictions. The cross-validation results indicated the high performance of PMiSLocMF with accuracy higher than 0.83, average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) exceeding 0.90 and 0.77, respectively. Such performance was better than all previous methods based on the same dataset. Further tests proved that using all feature types can improve the performance of PMiSLocMF, and GATE and self-attention layer can help enhance the performance. Finally, we deeply analyzed the influence of miRNA associations with diseases, drugs, and mRNAs on PMiSLocMF. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/Gu20201017/PMiSLocMF.},

The process of affinity maturation, wherein antibodies evolve through somatic mutations to achieve heightened specificity and affinity to target antigens, is crucial for effective immune response. Despite their significance, assessing antibody–antigen binding affinity remains challenging due to limitations in conventional wet lab techniques. To address this, we introduce AntiFormer, a graph-based large language model designed to predict antibody binding affinity. AntiFormer incorporates sequence information into a graph-based framework, allowing for precise prediction of binding affinity. Through extensive evaluations, AntiFormer demonstrates superior performance compared with existing methods, offering accurate predictions with reduced computational time. Application of AntiFormer to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patient samples reveals antibodies with strong neutralizing capabilities, providing insights for therapeutic development and vaccination strategies. Furthermore, analysis of individual samples following influenza vaccination elucidates differences in antibody response between young and older adults. AntiFormer identifies specific clonotypes with enhanced binding affinity post-vaccination, particularly in young individuals, suggesting age-related variations in immune response dynamics. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of large clonotype category in driving affinity maturation and immune modulation. Overall, AntiFormer is a promising approach to accelerate antibody-based diagnostics and therapeutics, bridging the gap between traditional methods and complex antibody maturation processes.},

DeepEnzyme also makes it possible to evaluate how point mutations affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme, which helps identify residue sites that are crucial for the catalytic function.

INTREPPPID outperforms all other leading PPI inference methods tested on both the intraspecies and cross-species tasks using strict evaluation datasets.

However, the experimental determination of pKa values is often laborious and complex. Moreover, existing prediction methods exhibit limitations in both the quantity and quality of the training data, as well as in their capacity to handle the complex structural and physicochemical properties of compounds, consequently impeding accuracy and generalization. Therefore, developing a method that can quickly and accurately predict molecular pKa values will to some extent help the structural modification of molecules, and thus assist the development process of new drugs. In this study, we developed a cutting-edge pKa prediction model named GR-pKa (Graph Retention pKa), leveraging a message-passing neural network and employing a multi-fidelity learning strategy to accurately predict molecular pKa values. The GR-pKa model incorporates five quantum mechanical properties related to molecular thermodynamics and dynamics as key features to characterize molecules. Notably, we originally introduced the novel retention mechanism into the message-passing phase, which significantly improves the model’s ability to capture and update molecular information. Our GR-pKa model outperforms several state-of-the-art models in predicting macro-pKa values, achieving impressive results with a low mean absolute error of 0.490 and root mean square error of 0.588, and a high R2 of 0.937 on the SAMPL7 dataset.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are critically important for the prediction, diagnosis, and characterization of diseases. However, identifying miRNA–disease associations through traditional biological experiments is both costly and time-consuming. To further explore these associations, we proposed a model based on hybrid high-order moments combined with element-level attention mechanisms (HHOMR). This model innovatively fused hybrid higher-order statistical information along with structural and community information. Specifically, we first constructed a heterogeneous graph based on existing associations between miRNAs and diseases. HHOMR employs a structural fusion layer to capture structure-level embeddings and leverages a hybrid high-order moments encoder layer to enhance features. Element-level attention mechanisms are then used to adaptively integrate the features of these hybrid moments. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron is utilized to calculate the association scores between miRNAs and diseases. Through five-fold cross-validation on HMDD v2.0, we achieved a mean AUC of 93.28\%. Compared with four state-of-the-art models, HHOMR exhibited superior performance. Additionally, case studies on three diseases—esophageal neoplasms, lymphoma, and prostate neoplasms—were conducted. Among the top 50 miRNAs with high disease association scores, 46, 47, and 45 associated with these diseases were confirmed by the dbDEMC and miR2Disease databases, respectively. Our results demonstrate that HHOMR not only outperforms existing models but also shows significant potential in predicting miRNA–disease associations.},

Although multiple algorithms of herb target prediction have been proposed, due to the incompleteness of clinical knowledge and the limitation of unsupervised models, accurate identification for herb targets still faces huge challenges of data and models. To address this, we proposed a deep learning-based target prediction framework termed HTINet2, which designed three key modules, namely, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and clinical knowledge graph embedding, residual graph representation learning, and supervised target prediction. In the first module, we constructed a large-scale knowledge graph that covers the TCM properties and clinical treatment knowledge of herbs, and designed a component of deep knowledge embedding to learn the deep knowledge embedding of herbs and targets. In the remaining two modules, we designed a residual-like graph convolution network to capture the deep interactions among herbs and targets, and a Bayesian personalized ranking loss to conduct supervised training and target prediction. Finally, we designed comprehensive experiments, of which comparison with baselines indicated the excellent performance of HTINet2 (HR@10 increased by 122.7\% and NDCG@10 by 35.7\%), ablation experiments illustrated the positive effect of our designed modules of HTINet2, and case study demonstrated the reliability of the predicted targets of Artemisia annua and Coptis chinensis based on the knowledge base, literature, and molecular docking.},

They are adept at generating responses that closely mimic human conversational patterns. One of the most notable examples is OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has been extensively used across diverse sectors. Despite their flexibility, a significant challenge arises as most users must transmit their data to the servers of companies operating these models. Utilizing ChatGPT or similar models online may inadvertently expose sensitive information to the risk of data breaches. Therefore, implementing LLMs that are open source and smaller in scale within a secure local network becomes a crucial step for organizations where ensuring data privacy and protection has the highest priority, such as regulatory agencies. As a feasibility evaluation, we implemented a series of open-source LLMs within a regulatory agency’s local network and assessed their performance on specific tasks involving extracting relevant clinical pharmacology information from regulatory drug labels. Our research shows that some models work well in the context of few- or zero-shot learning, achieving performance comparable, or even better than, neural network models that needed thousands of training samples. One of the models was selected to address a real-world issue of finding intrinsic factors that affect drugs' clinical exposure without any training or fine-tuning. In a dataset of over 700 000 sentences, the model showed a 78.5\% accuracy rate. Our work pointed to the possibility of implementing open-source LLMs within a secure local network and using these models to perform various natural language processing tasks when large numbers of training examples are unavailable.},

To address this challenge, we propose BertTCR, an innovative deep learning framework designed to predict cancer-related immune status using TCRs. BertTCR combines a pre-trained protein large language model with deep learning architectures, enabling it to extract deeper contextual information from TCRs. Compared to three state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, BertTCR improves the AUC on an external validation set for thyroid cancer detection by 21 percentage points. Additionally, this model was trained on over 2000 publicly available TCR libraries covering 17 types of cancer and healthy samples, and it has been validated on multiple public external datasets for its ability to distinguish cancer patients from healthy individuals. Furthermore, BertTCR can accurately classify various cancer types and healthy individuals. Overall, BertTCR is the advancing method for cancer-related immune status forecasting based on TCRs, offering promising potential for a wide range of immune status prediction tasks.},

The Haxe compiler is well known for its ability to translate the source code of Haxe programs into the source code of a variety of other programming languages including Java, C++, JavaScript, and Python. Although Haxe is more and more used for a variety of purposes, including games, it has not yet attracted much attention from bioinformaticians. This is surprising, as Haxe allows generating different versions of the same program (e.g. a graphical user interface version in JavaScript running in a web browser for beginners and a command-line version in C++ or Python for increased performance) while maintaining a single code, a feature that should be of interest for many bioinformatic applications. To demonstrate the usefulness of Haxe in bioinformatics, we present here the case story of the program SeqPHASE, written originally in Perl (with a CGI version running on a server) and published in 2010. As Perl+CGI is not desirable anymore for security purposes, we decided to rewrite the SeqPHASE program in Haxe and to host it at Github Pages (https://eeg-ebe.github.io/SeqPHASE), thereby alleviating the need to configure and maintain a dedicated server. Using SeqPHASE as an example, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Haxe’s source code conversion functionality when it comes to implementing bioinformatic software.},

	abstract = {Cyclic peptides are versatile therapeutic agents that boast high binding affinity, minimal toxicity, and the potential to engage challenging protein targets. However, the pharmaceutical utility of cyclic peptides is limited by their low membrane permeability—an essential indicator of oral bioavailability and intracellular targeting. Current machine learning-based models of cyclic peptide permeability show variable performance owing to the limitations of experimental data. Furthermore, these methods use features derived from the whole molecule that have traditionally been used to predict small molecules and ignore the unique structural properties of cyclic peptides. This study presents CycPeptMP: an accurate and efficient method to predict cyclic peptide membrane permeability. We designed features for cyclic peptides at the atom-, monomer-, and peptide-levels and seamlessly integrated these into a fusion model using deep learning technology. Additionally, we applied various data augmentation techniques to enhance model training efficiency using the latest data. The fusion model exhibited excellent prediction performance for the logarithm of permeability, with a mean absolute error of \$0.355\$ and correlation coefficient of \$0.883\$. Ablation studies demonstrated that all feature levels contributed and were relatively essential to predicting membrane permeability, confirming the effectiveness of augmentation to improve prediction accuracy. A comparison with a molecular dynamics-based method showed that CycPeptMP accurately predicted peptide permeability, which is otherwise difficult to predict using simulations.},

Establishing a complete cancer gene catalogue will make precision oncology possible. Although existing methods based on graph neural networks (GNN) are effective in identifying cancer genes, they fall short in effectively integrating data from multiple views and interpreting predictive outcomes. To address these shortcomings, an interpretable representation learning framework IMVRL-GCN is proposed to capture both shared and specific representations from multiview data, offering significant insights into the identification of cancer genes. Experimental results demonstrate that IMVRL-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art cancer gene identification methods and several baselines. Furthermore, IMVRL-GCN is employed to identify a total of 74 high-confidence novel cancer genes, and multiview data analysis highlights the pivotal roles of shared, mutation-specific, and structure-specific representations in discriminating distinctive cancer genes. Exploration of the mechanisms behind their discriminative capabilities suggests that shared representations are strongly associated with gene functions, while mutation-specific and structure-specific representations are linked to mutagenic propensity and functional synergy, respectively. Finally, our in-depth analyses of these candidates suggest potential insights for individualized treatments: afatinib could counteract many mutation-driven risks, and targeting interactions with cancer gene SRC is a reasonable strategy to mitigate interaction-induced risks for NR3C1, RXRA, HNF4A, and SP1.},

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 93,673 Korean subjects to uncover novel genetic loci linked to obesity, examining metrics such as body mass index, waist circumference, body fat ratio, and abdominal fat ratio. Participants were categorized into non-obese, metabolically healthy obese (MHO), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) groups. Using advanced computational methods, we developed a multifaceted polygenic risk scores (PRS) model to predict obesity. Our GWAS identified significant genetic effects with distinct sizes and directions within the MHO and MUO groups compared with the non-obese group. Gene-based and gene-set analyses, along with cluster analysis, revealed heterogeneous patterns of significant genes on chromosomes 3 (MUO group) and 11 (MHO group). In analyses targeting genetic predisposition differences based on metabolic health, odds ratios of high PRS compared with medium PRS showed significant differences between non-obese and MUO, and non-obese and MHO. Similar patterns were seen for low PRS compared with medium PRS. These findings were supported by the estimated genetic correlation (0.89 from bivariate GREML). Regional analyses highlighted significant local genetic correlations on chromosome 11, while single variant approaches suggested widespread pleiotropic effects, especially on chromosome 11. In conclusion, our study identifies specific genetic loci and risks associated with obesity in the Korean population, emphasizing the heterogeneous genetic factors contributing to MHO and MUO.},

To address this challenge, we present CHAI (consensus Clustering tHrough similArIty matrix integratIon for single cell-type identification), a wisdom of crowds approach for scRNAseq clustering. CHAI presents two competing methods which aggregate the clustering results from seven state-of-the-art clustering methods: CHAI-AvgSim and CHAI-SNF. CHAI-AvgSim and CHAI-SNF demonstrate superior performance across several benchmarking datasets. Furthermore, both CHAI methods outperform the most recent consensus clustering method, SAME-clustering. We demonstrate CHAI’s practical use case by identifying a leader tumor cell cluster enriched with CDH3. CHAI provides a platform for multiomic integration, and we demonstrate CHAI-SNF to have improved performance when including spatial transcriptomics data. CHAI overcomes previous limitations by incorporating the most recent and top performing scRNAseq clustering algorithms into the aggregation framework. It is also an intuitive and easily customizable R package where users may add their own clustering methods to the pipeline, or down-select just the ones they want to use for the clustering aggregation. This ensures that as more advanced clustering algorithms are developed, CHAI will remain useful to the community as a generalized framework.
